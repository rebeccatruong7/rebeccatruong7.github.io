# About Me
I currently analyze data @ [Mental Health Association of San Francisco](https://www.mentalhealthsf.org/). I graduated with a B.A. in Psychological Science and minor in International Studies from the University of California, Irvine. I like understanding people and their perspectives, hence my educational choices. Hopefully, I can do some good for the world through data-informed research. 

In my free time, I practice karate with [NKCBayArea](https://www.instagram.com/nkcbayarea/), study Cantonese and Mandarin, and spend time in nature. 

# Skills
I am most comfortable using Python, Microsoft Excel, and Google Sheets for data analysis and visualization. I have played with SQL, R, and Tableau in the past so I can pick these up if a project calls for it. 

**Python libraries:** pandas, numpy, regex, matplotlib, seaborn   
**Microsoft Excel tools:** Pivot Tables, XLOOKUP, charting

# Projects
