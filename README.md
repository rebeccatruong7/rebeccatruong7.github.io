# Work Experience

---

**Superior Court of California, County of Alameda** | Dec 2023 - Mar 2024  
During my brief time here, I assisted the Court in building and migrating to a new database.  
➡️ Over the next 10 years, this new database, in conjunction with other organizational initiatives, will modernize the organization, allowing staff to produce higher quality work

**Mental Health Association of San Francisco** | Sep 2021 - Nov 2023   
While working in my initial role as a warmline counselor, I advanced the organization by looking at the under-utilized call system data to:  
⭐ inform staffing, hiring, and shift-scheduling decisions ➡️ resulted in a 72% increase in answer rate over 3-6 months!  
⭐ update outdated performance metrics ➡️ resulted in nuanced changes to internal performance metrics!  
⭐ assess the impact of new programs on the warmline  ( In other words, was the goal achieved? ) ➡️ quantified the success of an advertising push in call counts for the first time!  
⭐ describe warmline performance in concrete terms ➡️ the concrete metrics assisted in securing increased funding to increase staff count by 2X


# About Me

---

Hi, I am Rebecca! I am a junior data analyst with experience in non-profits and government. In spring 2021, I graduated from UC Irvine with a B.A. in Psychology and a minor in International Studies.  
   
🌍 My formal education is reflective of my curiosity about people, communities, and how many individuals can organize together to accomplish one goal.  
📚 Data analysis, research, and storytelling became the method to investigate those curiosities when I realized how poor decision-making often arises due to a lack of accurate and complete information.  

❓ **CAREER GAP EXPLAINED** ❓  
You might be wondering why I have a gap in my resume following my job at the Superior Court of Alameda.  
🧓 I voluntarily left that position to become a full-time caregiver for a loved one who is doing much better now.  
🥖 In the time since I have taken two part-time jobs at a local bakery and cross-guarding for elementary schools. I've always wanted to try both!  
✨ I have also been polishing my skills through portfolio projects, and courses, and thoughtfully consuming relevant content.  

🐇 Now I am ready to hop back into the work sphere!

🌱 **HOBBIES** 🌱  
☀️ In my free time, I like being outside in nature, around people, and preferably under a bright blue sky. I also spend a lot of time training at my karate dojo. If I am feeling like a homebody, I will bake delicious sweets that will surely increase your life satisfaction, but not longevity.
