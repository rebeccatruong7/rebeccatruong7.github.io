# About Me
I currently analyze data @ [Mental Health Association of San Francisco](https://www.mentalhealthsf.org/). 

I'd like to do some good for the world through **data-informed research**. I graduated with a B.A. in Psychological Science and a minor in International Studies from the *University of California, Irvine*.   

I talk a lot about [accessible cities](https://www.youtube.com/c/NotJustBikes), [social mobility](https://opportunityinsights.org/), and [gender equality](https://youtu.be/GuWr-v3TOO8?si=RD4CB7WyoVOd1f4O). In my free time, I practice karate with friends, chat with strangers in Chinese, and lie around in parks.  

I enjoy meeting new people, so you are more than welcome to email me at [rebeccatruong7@gmail.com](mailto:rebeccatruong7@gmail.com) and connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccatruong7/).

# Projects 

## Python Analysis 
### [Government Policies Have Dimmed the Pearl of the East:   *After a costly pandemic, air travel to Hong Kong has halved.*](https://medium.com/@rebeccatruong7/government-policies-have-dimmed-the-pearl-of-the-east-bd0f1a855536)
Within the past few years, Hong Kong has faced great political turmoil and strict COVID response procedures, causing an irrevocable shift in culture, leading residents and companies to flee the city in droves. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I **_aggregated_**, **_cleaned_**, and **_analyzed_** the data from 10+ public data sources to **_quantify_** the change in Hong Kong air travel. I published my extensive **_research_**, **_analysis_**, and **_data visualizations_** in a comprehensive Medium article.

## Tableau Dashboards
### [COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker](https://public.tableau.com/views/COVIDDashboard_16911063239220/GlobalVaccineTracker?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) 
I **_visualized_** the proportion of people vaccinated globally (October 2021) using Tableau and MS Excel.

### [Seattle AirBnB Pricing](https://public.tableau.com/views/AirBnBFullProject_16555083090270/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link ) 
I **_visualized_** the prices of AirBnBs in Seattle in relation to a variety of variables including number of bedrooms, zip code, and time of year. 
 
## SQL Query
### [Nashville Housing](https://github.com/rebeccatruong7/Data-Projects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20Cleaning%20Queries.sql) 
Using SQL, I **_queried_** and **_cleaned_** a dataset containing information on the sale date, sale price, land value, and number of beds and baths for housing in Nashville, Tennessee.
