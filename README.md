# Work Experience

---

**Superior Court of California, County of Alameda** | Dec 2023 - Mar 2024  
During my brief time here, I assisted the Court in building and migrating to a new database by:  
⭐ validating data across four ecosystems  
⭐ working closely with the IT department and the vendor in charge of creating the database  
➡️ It's difficult to quantify the impact of this work because the changes will be seen over the next 10 years. The hope is that the new database, in conjunction with other organizational initiatives, will modernize the Court for the betterment of the public. 

**Mental Health Association of San Francisco** | Sep 2021 - Nov 2023   
While working in my initial role as a warmline counselor, I advanced the organization by looking at the under-utilized call system data to:  
⭐ inform staffing, hiring, and shift-scheduling decisions ➡️ resulted in a 72% increase in answer rate over 3-6 months!  
⭐ update outdated performance metrics ➡️ resulted in nuanced changes to internal performance metrics!  
⭐ assess the impact of new programs on the warmline  ( In other words, was the goal achieved? ) ➡️ quantified the success of an advertising push in call counts for the first time!  
⭐ describe warmline performance in concrete terms ➡️ the concrete metrics assisted in securing increased funding to increase staff count by 2X


# About Me

---

Hi, I am Rebecca! I am a junior data analyst with experience in non-profits and government. In spring 2021, I graduated from UC Irvine with a B.A. in Psychology and a minor in International Studies.  
🌍 My formal education is reflective of my curiosity about people, communities, and how many individuals can organize together to accomplish one goal.  
📚 Data analysis, research, and storytelling became the method to investigate those curiosities when I realized how poor decision-making often arises due to a lack of accurate and complete information.  

❓ You might be wondering why I have a gap in my resume following my job at the Superior Court of Alameda. I voluntarily left that position to become a full-time caregiver for a loved one who is doing much better now. In the time since I have taken two part-time jobs at a local bakery and cross-guarding for elementary schools. I've always wanted to try both! I have also been polishing my skills through portfolio projects, and courses, and thoughtfully consuming relevant content.  

🐇 Now I am ready to hop back into the work sphere!

☀️ In my free time, I like being outside in nature, around people, and preferably under a bright blue sky. I also spend a lot of time training at my karate dojo. If I am feeling like a homebody, I will bake delicious sweets that will surely increase your life satisfaction, but not longevity.
