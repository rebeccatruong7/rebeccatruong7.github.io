# About Me
I currently analyze data @ [Mental Health Association of San Francisco](https://www.mentalhealthsf.org/). 

I'd like to do some good for the world through **data-informed research**. I graduated with a B.A. in Psychological Science and a minor in International Studies from the *University of California, Irvine*.   

My current interests, at the moment, revolve around [accessible cities](https://www.youtube.com/c/NotJustBikes), [foreign languages](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-language-shapes-thought/), and [social mobility](https://opportunityinsights.org/). For fun, I enjoy spending time in nature and practicing my Chinese! 

I enjoy meeting new people, so feel more than welcome to email me at [rebeccatruong7@gmail.com](mailto:rebeccatruong7@gmail.com) .

# Projects 

## Python Analysis 
### [Government Policies Have Dimmed the Pearl of the East:   *After a costly pandemic, air travel to Hong Kong has halved.*](https://medium.com/@rebeccatruong7/government-policies-have-dimmed-the-pearl-of-the-east-bd0f1a855536)
Within the past few years, Hong Kong has faced great political turmoil and strict COVID response procedures, causing an irrevocable shift in culture, leading residents and companies to flee the city in droves. Using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**, I _aggregated_, _cleaned,_ and _analyzed_ the data from 10+ public data sources to _quantify_ the change in Hong Kong air travel. I published my extensive research, analysis, and data visualizations in a comprehensive Medium article.

## Tableau Dashboards
### [COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker](https://public.tableau.com/views/COVIDDashboard_16911063239220/GlobalVaccineTracker?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) 
I created an interactive dashboard to visualize the proportion of people vaccinated globally (October 2021).

### [Seattle AirBnB Pricing](https://public.tableau.com/views/AirBnBFullProject_16555083090270/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link ) 
The dashboard displays the prices of AirBnBs in Seattle by a variety of variables including number of bedrooms, zip code, and time of year. 
 
## SQL Query
### [Nashville Housing](https://github.com/rebeccatruong7/Data-Projects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20Cleaning%20Queries.sql) 
I cleaned a dataset containing information about housing units in Nashville, Tennesee. Columns include sale date, sale price, land value, and number of beds and baths.
