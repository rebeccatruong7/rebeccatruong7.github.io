# About Me
Hello! The internet is a very scary place, but I am indeed a real person (here's a typo to proove it). I currently analyze data @ [Mental Health Association of San Francisco](https://www.mentalhealthsf.org/). I am looking for positions in which I can work on **data-informed research** for the common good.

I graduated with a B.A. in Psychological Science and a minor in International Studies from the *University of California, Irvine*. I can talk for a long time about [accessible cities](https://www.youtube.com/c/NotJustBikes), [social mobility](https://opportunityinsights.org/), and [gender equality](https://youtu.be/GuWr-v3TOO8?si=RD4CB7WyoVOd1f4O). When I need a break from the world, I practice karate with friends, chat with strangers in Chinese, and laze around in parks.  

I enjoy meeting new people, so feel free to contact me at [rebeccatruong7@gmail.com](mailto:rebeccatruong7@gmail.com) for a virtual chat!

# Projects 

## Python Analysis 
### [Government Policies Have Dimmed the Pearl of the East:   *After a costly pandemic, air travel to Hong Kong has halved.*](https://medium.com/@rebeccatruong7/government-policies-have-dimmed-the-pearl-of-the-east-bd0f1a855536)
In the past few years, Hong Kong has faced great political turmoil and strict COVID response procedures, causing an irrevocable shift in culture, leading residents and companies to flee the city in droves. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I **_aggregated_**, **_cleaned_**, and **_analyzed_** the data from 10+ public data sources to **_quantify_** the change in Hong Kong air travel. I published my extensive **_research_**, **_analysis_**, and **_data visualizations_** in a comprehensive Medium article.

## Tableau Dashboard
### [COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker](https://public.tableau.com/views/COVIDDashboard_16911063239220/GlobalVaccineTracker?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) 
I **_visualized_** the proportion of people vaccinated globally (October 2021) using Tableau and MS Excel.

### [Seattle AirBnB Pricing](https://public.tableau.com/views/AirBnBFullProject_16555083090270/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link ) 
I **_visualized_** the prices of AirBnBs in Seattle in relation to a variety of variables including number of bedrooms, zip code, and time of year. 
 
## SQL Query
### [Nashville Housing](https://github.com/rebeccatruong7/Data-Projects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20Cleaning%20Queries.sql) 
Using SQL, I **_queried_** and **_cleaned_** a dataset containing information on the sale date, sale price, land value, and number of beds and baths for housing in Nashville, Tennessee.
