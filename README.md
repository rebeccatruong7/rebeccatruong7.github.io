# About Me
I currently analyze data @ [Mental Health Association of San Francisco](https://www.mentalhealthsf.org/). 

I enjoy understanding people and their perspectives. I graduated with a B.A. in Psychological Science and a minor in International Studies from the *University of California, Irvine*. I hope to do some good for the world through data-informed research. At the moment, I try to inject the following topics into every conversation: [accessible cities](https://www.youtube.com/c/NotJustBikes), [foreign languages](https://www.italki.com), and [social mobility](https://opportunityinsights.org/).

I enjoy meeting new people, so feel more than welcome to email me at rebeccatrong7{at}gmail{dot}com! 

# Skills
I am most comfortable using Python, Microsoft Excel, and Google Sheets for data analysis and visualization. I have played with SQL, R, and Tableau in the past so I can pick these up if a project calls for it. 

**Python libraries:** pandas, numpy, regex, matplotlib, seaborn   
**Microsoft Excel tools:** Pivot Tables, XLOOKUP, charting
